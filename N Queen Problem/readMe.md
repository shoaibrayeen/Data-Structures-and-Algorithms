## The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

### The expected output is a binary matrix which has 1s for the blocks where queens are placed. For example, following is the output matrix for above 4 queen solution.
    { 0,  1,  0,  0}
    { 0,  0,  0,  1}
    { 1,  0,  0,  0}
    { 0,  0,  1,  0}
