## Given 3 strings of all having length < 100,the task is to find the longest common sub-sequence in all three given sequences.
### Examples:
### Input : str1 = "geeks"  
###         str2 = "geeksfor"  
###         str3 = "geeksforgeeks"
### Output : 5
### Longest common subsequence is "geeks"
### i.e., length = 5

### Input : str1 = "abcd1e2"  
###         str2 = "bc12ea"  
###         str3 = "bd1ea"
### Output : 3
### Longest common subsequence is "b1e" 
### i.e. length = 3.
