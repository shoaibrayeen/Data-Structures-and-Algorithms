## Given a sorted array and a value x, the floor of x is the largest element in array smaller than or equal to x. Write efficient functions to find floor of x.

```
Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19}, x = 5
Output : 2
2 is the largest element in arr[] smaller than 5.

Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19}, x = 20
Output : 19
19 is the largest element in arr[] smaller than 20.

Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19}, x = 0
Output : -1
Since floor doesn't exist, output is -1
```
