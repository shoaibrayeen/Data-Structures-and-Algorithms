## Write a function to count number of smaller elements on right of each element in an array. Given an unsorted array arr[] of distinct integers, construct another array countSmaller[] such that countSmaller[i] contains count of smaller elements on right side of each element arr[i] in array.
```
Input:   arr[] =  {12, 1, 2, 3, 0, 11, 4}
Output:  countSmaller[]  =  {6, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0} 

(Corner Cases)
Input:   arr[] =  {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
Output:  countSmaller[]  =  {4, 3, 2, 1, 0} 

Input:   arr[] =  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output:  countSmaller[]  =  {0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
```
