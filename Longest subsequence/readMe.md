# Longest subsequence such that difference between adjacents is one
## Given an array of n size, the task is to find the longest subsequence such that difference between adjacents is one.

### Input :  arr[] = {10, 9, 4, 5, 4, 8, 6}
### Output :  3
### As longest subsequences with difference 1 are, "10, 9, 8", 
### ### "4, 5, 4" and "4, 5, 6"

### Input :  arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 7, 2, 1}
### Output :  7
### As longest consecutive sequence is "1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1"
