## Given a rope of length n meters, cut the rope in different parts of integer lengths in a way that maximizes product of lengths of all parts. You must make at least one cut. Assume that the length of rope is more than 2 meters.
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 1 (Maximum obtainable product is 1*1)

Input: n = 3
Output: 2 (Maximum obtainable product is 1*2)

Input: n = 4
Output: 4 (Maximum obtainable product is 2*2)

Input: n = 5
Output: 6 (Maximum obtainable product is 2*3)

Input: n = 10
Output: 36 (Maximum obtainable product is 3*3*4)
